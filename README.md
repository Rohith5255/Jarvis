# Jarvis Voice Assistant üéôÔ∏èüíª

This is my personal Python-based voice assistant, **Jarvis**, that can listen to my commands, talk back to me, and perform some basic tasks like:

- Opening websites (Google, YouTube, LinkedIn)
- Opening the Spotify desktop app
- Fetching live weather updates (via OpenWeatherMap API)
- Responding to simple voice prompts
- Exiting gracefully on voice command

It‚Äôs built using Python and a few awesome libraries for speech recognition and text-to-speech.
